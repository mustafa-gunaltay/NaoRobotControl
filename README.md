# NaoRobotControl

This project utilizes **C++** and the **Webots** simulation environment to control and process sensor data from the **Nao robot**. Designed using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, the system processes sensor data through an **abstract interface** and provides various control mechanisms for the robot.

## Features

- **Robot Interface**: `RobotInterface` class ensures API abstraction.
- **Sensor Integration**: Sonar, Bumper, and Force sensors are integrated.
- **Control Mechanisms**: Robot movement functions are implemented.
- **Data Management**: Data recording and access control mechanisms for security.

## Scalability

This structure offers a **scalable architecture** that can be easily adapted to different robot platforms.
